# MCU-Algorithms

<p>While playing with Github and it's cohort Git, I would like to continue with actual work. The MCU-Algorithms is a collection of a multitude of small C++ snippets yet they're complete as stand-alone code. For now, the MCU used is the ATmega328P on a protoboard (breadboard). The programming is done on the VS Code using the PlatformIO core. The electronic circuits may be displayed that depends on the format types here at GitHub. The MCU may be linked to other devices like another MCU in a master-slave relationship along with a bi-directional communication with an experimenting computing device. The robot used is a simple two wheeled differential drive mobile agent. Unforunately ROS is not used here but maybe the snippet codes can be tested on a simulation. The organization is yet to be dertermined. </p>
