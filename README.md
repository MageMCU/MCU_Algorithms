## About MCU-Algorithms <a name="about-mcu-algorithms"></a>

The MCU-Algorithms is a collection of small C++ snippets yet they're complete as stand-alone code.

## MCU chip  <a name="mcu-chip"></a>

This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is used here. The **cheaper** ... the **better**... Knowledge for those who want to learn.

## Joystick <a name="joystick"></a>

The analog 2-axis thumb joystick with button by Makerfabs (China). The joystick has two analog(10k potentiometers), you'll need two analog (ADC) reading pins on your microcontroller to determine X and Y.

## Functions <a name="joystick-functions"></a>

The list of functions used to support the analog joystick.

 - Map() <a name="map-function"></a> <br/> (T) class-name::map(T-parameters) - The function maps the domain of (x) onto the range of f(x) such that f(x) is a linear function where f(x) = ax + b. The T-parameters uses a known value (x) and two known points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2) where the parameters are map(x, x1, x2, y1, y2). The return type (T) is the unknown value f(x) = y. The template type (T) defines the template data type such as int or float.
