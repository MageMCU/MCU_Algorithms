## About MCU-Algorithms <a name="about-mcu-algorithms"></a>

<p>The MCU-Algorithms is a collection of small C++ snippets yet they're complete as stand-alone code. </p>

## Description <a name="description"></a>

<p>The MCU used is the ATmega328P on a protoboard (breadboard). The programming is done on the VS Code using the PlatformIO core. The electronic circuits may be displayed when appropriate. The MCU may be linked to other devices like another MCU in a master-slave relationship along with a bi-directional communication with an experimenting computing device. The robot used is a simple two wheeled differential drive mobile agent. Unforunately ROS is not used here but maybe the snippet codes can be tested on a simulation. </p>

## Purpose <a name="purpose"></a>

<p>I am cleaning out the file cabinet full of old articles on tested algorithms for a variety of subjects in robotics. Although I am no engineer, I did put togeather a rudimentary robot to study the interfacing and programming of MCUs. The reasoning behind the repository publication is not to show off my ignorance but to further my studies in C++ templates along with metaprogramming. Therefore, it would be nice to hear from others on improving the code. Please keep in mind that the memory size is quite small for the embedded firmware. </p>
